      <description>As a software developer, you should know following numbers to help you understand how your software performs in big picture. The point here is not to remember these numbers exactly, but to have a sense of relative magnitude. For example, reading from memory is 100,000 times faster than reading from disk (10 ms disk seek in this case). So you should always try to read from memory rather than disk and having a memory cache can really boost the performance.</description>
